			The work carried out in this area has been mainly oriented to systems for remote browsing 
			of JPEG2000 images: the standard JPEG2000 has been deeply studied, the existing technologies and
			methods to build this kind of systems, within as well as outside the standard, have been 
			analyzed and evaluated, and i have worked actively with the  <a href="jpip/">JPIP</a> protocol 
			(participation in the Google Summer of Code 2006 developing a Java client/server solution
			for JPIP and collaboration implementing this protocol for the Java 
			Advanced Imaging API).
			Currently new methods (prefetching, transcoding, etc.) and protocols (JPIP-W, peer-to-peer, etc.)
			are being researched and developed in order to try to achieve the state-of-the-art of this kind
			of systems.
			</p>
			<p>
			Another works have been carried out in this area, as for example the collaboration in
			the design of the FSVC (Fully Scalable Video Codec) video codec based on JPEG2000, and
			the development of efficient telepathology systems based on virtual slides with 
			JPEG2000 (stitching methods and medical images transmission).

				The work that is carried out in this area is oriented to the measure and test vehicles
				of the Tests Center of Michelin in Almer&iacute;a:
				design of autoguided vehicles, implementation of GPS fleet tracking solutions, 
				control and measure systems based on CAN bus, etc. This work, due to confidentiality
				restrictions, can not be published.
			</p>
			<p>
				The image processing field is also tackled, having developed several related solutions for the
				Tests Center of Michelin in Almer&iacute;a. These applications are used in order to get measures
				and information from tires by means of digital images.
			</p>	
			<p>
				Parallely, under the PhD program "Systems Engineering and Automation" 
				at the National University of Education at a Distance, the use of the hibrid systems theory 
				for the design of intelligent vehicles and multiagent solutions for <a href="traffic/">traffic control</a>
				is being researched.
